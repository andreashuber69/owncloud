# Take Full Control of All Your Data

## Introduction
These days, many people store almost all of their data with a cloud service offered by the likes of Apple, Microsoft and
Google. The data is often very sensitive in nature (e.g. Photos, Contacts, Calendars) and is rarely encrypted. 

This project is dedicated to provide detailed instructions on how to set up, use and maintain your own alternative to
such a cloud service without compromising much in terms of functionality or convenience. The center piece is a tiny,
energy-efficient server running in your home 24/7.

## Audience & Prerequisites
While I try very hard to clearly describe every tiny step on the way to your data sovereignity, I do realize that it's
impossible to suit everyone. So, to successfully follow these instructions, you should at least have the following:
- Experience using a current desktop or laptop computer (running **Linux**, **Mac OS** or **Windows**) with a keyboard
  and mouse
- Experience using a current mobile phone running **Android**
- A home network: As soon as you have the box of an internet provider running at home, chances are very high you already
  have a home network, at least a wireless one (which is all we need).
- Knowledge about how to connect a new device to your home network (wirelessly or with a cable)
- A keyboard and mouse with USB A connectors
- A TV or computer monitor with a HDMI A input (almost all recent devices have such an input)
- A HDMI cable with two HMDI A connectors
- Spare USD 70 to spend on your new home server

## Scope
These instructions only cover what I've personally done (and tested), namely:
- Build your **Raspberry Pi** box (main board, power supply, storage card, housing)
- Install **ownCloud** on a brand-new **Raspbery Pi 3 Model B**
- Backup **ownCloud** data
- Restore **ownCloud** data
- File sync between **ownCloud** and **Windows** and/or **Ubuntu** PCs
- File sync between **owncloud** and **Android** phones
- Contact import into **ownCloud** via **vCard** files
- Contact sync between **ownCloud** and **Android** phones
- Tasks sync between **ownCloud** and **Android** phones

It is worth noting that **ownCloud** is a very feature-rich platform. So, if you have additional requirements, it's
likely that they can be implemented with **ownCloud**.
