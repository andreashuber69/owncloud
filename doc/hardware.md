# Acquiring and Assembling Your Raspberry Pi 3 B

## What to Buy
It's probably easiest and cheapest to buy one of the many kits. Right now, ebay.com lists over 200 results. See below on
what a kit should minimally include. Of course, if you already have some items (like e.g. a **microSD** card and a 5V
power supply) you might end up paying less by just ordering single items.

### Required Items
- **Raspberry Pi 3 B** main board
- Heatsinks for the CPU and the memory chip
- Fast **microSD** card with 16GB or more
- High quality 5V power supply, with a guaranteed 2.5A or higher
- Case

### Optional Items
- Fan: Many kits, especially the ones aimed at building entertainment devices, include CPU fans. In my experience such a
  fan is not necessary for our purposes. The highest CPU temperatures I've observed (e.g. during backup or initial sync)
  are still well within the green range. For >95% of the time, the **Raspberry Pi** will be running idle anyway. So,
  even if the CPU does become a little hot for a minute a day, that should not reduce its lifespan meaningfully. Also,
  the CPU will automatically throttle back should it ever become critically hot.

## Assembling Your Raspberry Pi Box
The main board and/or the kit should include instructions, but sadly guidance on how to handle electronics is often
missing:  
- You should ground yourself beforehand e.g. by touching a metal water spigot.
- Try to avoid direct contact with any of the components on the main board, by only touching the edges.
